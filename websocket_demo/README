Within this folder you will find a very basic WebSocket demo.
It consists of three components, namely;

- the webserver (lighttpd-1.4.32 with mod_websocket)
- the server handling the data eventually (ws_server)
- the HTML/JavaScript client (index.html)

The communication basically goes like this:

----------------            ----------------            ----------------      
|              | (3 nums)   |              | (3 nums)   |              |
|    client    | ========>  |   webserver  | ========>  |    server    |
| (index.html) | <========  |  (lighttpd)  | <========  |  (ws_server) |
|              |  (3 nums)  |              |  (3 nums)  |              |
----------------            ----------------            ----------------



------------ Requirements:

For lighttpd, mod_websocket and ws_server:
- gcc
- make


For lighttpd and mod_websocket:
- bison
- autoconf
- automake
- libtool
- libev3
- libcunit
- libicu
- libpcre
- zlib
- bzip2

NOTE: Please compare this to the requirements named by lighttpd and mod_websocket
themselves; this list might still be incomplete.


For the client:
- WebSocket-able browser, i.e. Firefox, Chrome, Opera



------------ Build instructions:

For ws_server:

Change to the ws_server directory and execute
$ make


For lighttpd and mod_websocket:

If you have installed all dependencies, running
$ ./auto_install.sh
should do the trick for you. If you don't use sudo, comment out the last line and do 
it manually.



------------ How to use this:
1. Start ws_server

2. Start lighttpd by changing to this directory and running
$ lighttpd -D -f ./lighttpd.conf

3. Open the following link in a WebSocket-able browser:
