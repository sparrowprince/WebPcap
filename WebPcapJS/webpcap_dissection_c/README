Small C program which provides methods to dissect packets and display them as
HTML snippets (to be used with the webpcap application).

For this, it still needs to be compiled via emscripten; for now, the dissection
routines work only as a stand-alone demo.

Requirements:

- gcc
- glib
- libwireshark, libwiretap, libwsutil (comes with Wireshark)
- make

Build instructions:

Just execute the following command and you should have a working binary:

$ make

Emscripten build instructions:

To be done!
